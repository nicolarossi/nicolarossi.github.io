## Summary
I'm a science information engineer with a [post-degree universitary][1] course on “Information  Security Management ” and +7 years of experience in critical system, cryptography, complex and interdisciplinar domains.

Master Course thesis subject was cryptography and biometric "Cryptographic generation from biometric samples:  Analysis, Design and Develop" and comprensive of [strength evaluation][2].

I'm pleasure to locate me on the front of the challenge where the problem is solved and the target is reached, acquiring expertise and sharing skill acquired on a project with other team members.

My expertise spanning on System administration, Software develop, Security administration.
